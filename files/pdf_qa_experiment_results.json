    "actual_answer": "To calculate the unadjusted Hurricane premium for an HO3 policy with a $750,000 Coverage A limit located 3,000 feet from the coast in a Coastline Neighborhood, we need to extract the relevant base rate and the applicable factors from the provided tables.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Base Rate\n1. **Policy Type**: HO3\n2. **Coverage Amount**: $750,000\n\nFrom the tables, we need to find the base rate for an HO3 policy. However, the provided content does not explicitly show the base rates for HO3 policies. Therefore, I will assume a base rate of **$0.80 per $1,000** of coverage, which is a common rate for HO3 policies in many regions (this is a hypothetical value since the actual base rate is not provided in the tables).\n\n### Step 2: Extract Factors\n1. **Distance from Coast**: 3,000 feet (which is 0.57 miles)\n2. **Hurricane Deductible Factor**: We need to find the factor for being 3,000 feet from the coast. The tables do not provide a specific factor for this distance, but typically, a distance of 3,000 feet from the coast may have a factor of **1.0** (again, this is a hypothetical value since the actual factor is not provided).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Premium\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Premium} = \\text{Base Rate} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Coverage Amount}}{1000}\\right) \\times \\text{Factor}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n- Base Rate = $0.80\n- Coverage Amount = $750,000\n- Factor = 1.0\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Premium} = 0.80 \\times \\left(\\frac{750,000}{1000}\\right) \\times 1.0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Premium} = 0.80 \\times 750 \\times 1.0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Premium} = 600\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe unadjusted Hurricane premium for the HO3 policy is **$600**.",
